> GOAL: Download all published exercise lists that the app provides. For each day, a list containing 10 questions is published by a teacher during his online class. They started publishing it back to 2018. This platform is pretty popular for high school exams prep in Brazil.

App links:
- [Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.paperx.dez&hl=en)

- [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/br/app/10-segundos/id1423819351)

Thinking process: 

- Initially, using a proxy I identified the API endpoint that the app requests data. Although there is an auth on the app, those requests don't require authentication.
- Then I realized that there is a single S3 bucket and for each day they insert a new JavaScript file that exports a module containing the exercises list for that day.
- On the app, when you want to see the exercises list for some day, it fetches directly the JavaScript file. The url changes only by a hardcoded date such as the following example

[```http://s3-sa-east-1.amazonaws.com/trivia-paperx-production/lives/2020-05-15/questions.js```](http://s3-sa-east-1.amazonaws.com/trivia-paperx-production/lives/2020-05-15/questions.js)

- Given that, we could get all available exercise lists only by changing the date on the url. After this url fuzzing I could come up with data since 2018. A total of 5k+ unique questions have been merged and are available on the file ```output.js```.
