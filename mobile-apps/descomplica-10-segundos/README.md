> GOAL: Download all published scholar questions that the app provides. For each day, a list containing 10 questions is published by a teacher during his class. They started publishing it back to 2018.

Thinking process: Initially, using a proxy I identified the API endpoint that the app requests data.

Then I realized that there is a single S3 bucket and for each day they insert a new JavaScript file that exports a module containing the exercises list for that day.

On the app, when you want to see the exercises list for some day, it fetches directly the JavaScript file. The url changes only by a hardcoded date.

Revisapp is an iOS/Android app that helps students reviewing school subjects in Brazil. They have done a great job creating lots of images for each subjects (e.g. for chemistry there are icons for acid, basis, inorganic equations, organic equations, and so forth).

The goal of this pentent was just to reverse-engineer the app and download the complete visual identity of the app. All images are pre-loaded on the sdk.
